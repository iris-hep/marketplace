    Injects C++ code into the query to initialize a tool of the specified type.

    This function sets up the necessary C++ code to create and initialize a tool (such as
    BTaggingSelectionTool) in the analysis workflow. The tool will be available in the C++
    code under the variable name specified by `tool_name`, which can be referenced in
    initialization lines and later code.

    Args:
        query: The ObjectStream to attach the tool initialization metadata to.
        tool_name: The variable name to use for the tool instance in the C++ code.
        tool_type: The C++ class name of the tool to instantiate.
        include_files: List of C++ header files to include for the tool.
        init_lines: List of C++ code lines to run for tool initialization. You can use
            `{tool_name}` in these lines to refer to the tool variable. You should
            include the call to `ANA_CHECK({tool_name}->initialize());`.

    Returns:
        A tuple containing:
            - The updated ObjectStream with the tool initialization metadata.
            - A ToolInfo object containing the tool's name. Pass this to `make_tool_accessor`

    Creates a Python-callable accessor for a C++ tool in the func_adl query.

    This function generates a Python function that, when called in a func_adl query,
    injects C++ code to call a method or function on a C++ tool instance (such as
    BTaggingSelectionTool). The accessor function can be used in the query to access
    tool functionality as if it were a regular Python function.

    Args:
        t_info: ToolInfo object containing the tool's variable name.
        function_name: Name of the accessor function (used in C++ and Python).
        source_code: List of C++ code lines to execute for the accessor. You can use
            `{tool_name}` in these lines to refer to the tool variable.
        arguments: Iterable of (argument_name, type) tuples specifying the arguments
            for the accessor function.

        return_type_python: The Python return type annotation as a string.
